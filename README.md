My name is John Eliades, I have a Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering and I'm working towards gaining experience as a professional in this field. I have taught unruly undergraduate students how to code for 3 years and have worked as a network administrator for the army for 7 months, while fulfilling my military obligations. My interests and expertise are in software, networks, and security.
